    <p>Front End Development: The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is termed the front end. It is
        also referred to as the 'client side' of the application. It includes everything that users experience directly:
        text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript are the languages used for Front End development. The structure, design, behavior, and content of
        everything seen on browser screens when websites, web applications, or mobile apps are opened up, is implemented
        by front End developers. Responsiveness and performance are two main objectives of the Front End. The developer
        must ensure that the site is responsive i.e. it appears correctly on devices of all sizes no part of the website
        should behave abnormally irrespective of the size of the screen. </p>
    <p>Backend Development: Backend is the server-side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure
        everything on the client-side of the website works fine. It is the part of the website that you cannot see and
        interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. The parts and
        characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application.
        Activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with system components without user interfaces or
        even systems of scientific programming, are also included in the backend. </p>
