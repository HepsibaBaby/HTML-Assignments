        A printer is a hardware output device that is used to generate hard copy and print any document. A document can
        be of any type such as a text file, image, or the combination of both. It accepts input command by users on a
        computer or on other devices to print the documents. For example, if you have to submit a project report at your
        college, you need to create a soft copy of your report and print it with the help of the printer.
        Printers are one of the common computer peripheral devices that can be classified into two categories that are
        2D and 3D printers. The 2D printers are used to print text and graphics on a paper, and 3D printers are used to
        create three dimensional physical objects.
