        A keyboard is one of the primary input devices that allows users to input text into a computer or any other
        electronic machinery. It is a peripheral device that is the most basic way for the user to communicate with a
        computer. It consists of multiple buttons, which create numbers, symbols, and letters, and special keys like the
        Windows and Alt key, including performing other functions. The design of the keyboard comes from the typewriter
        keyboards, and numbers and letters are arranged on the keyboard in that way, which helps to type quickly.
