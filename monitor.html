        A monitor is an electronic output device that is also known as a video display terminal (VDT) or a video display
        unit (VDU). It is used to display images, text, video, and graphics information generated by a connected
        computer via a computer's video card. Although it is almost like a TV, its resolution is much higher than a TV.
        The first computer monitor was introduced on 1 March 1973, which was part of the Xerox Alto computer system.

        Older monitors were built by using a fluorescent screen and Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), which made them heavy and
        large in size and thus causing them to cover more space on the desk. Nowadays, all monitors are made up by using
        flat-panel display technology, commonly backlit with LEDs. These modern monitors take less space on the desk as
        compared to older CRT displays.
