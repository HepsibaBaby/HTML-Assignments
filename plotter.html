        A plotter is a type of printer that prints vector graphics. It is a piece of computer gear that converts
        computer commands into paper line drawings. It draws a line with one or more automatic pens. Unlike a
        traditional printer, a plotter uses a pen, marker, pencil, or other writing tools to draw multiple rather than
        toner. It may also use vector graphics files or commands to draw continuous point-to-point lines. Though it was
        previously widely used for computer-aided design, it is now only used to print hard copies of schematics and
        other comparable application.
